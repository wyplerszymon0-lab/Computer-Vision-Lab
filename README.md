## Features

### 1. Face Detection (`face_detection.py`)
- Real-time bounding box detection using Haar Cascades.
- Live face counter overlay.

### 2. 3D Face Mesh Recorder (`face_landmarks_recorder.py`)
- Deep learning-based 468 landmark mapping.
- High-fidelity eye and lip tracking.
- Automatic session recording to `.avi` format.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
